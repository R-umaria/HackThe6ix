# About The Project
ALEx! (The Alertness Level Expert) is an AI-powered co-driver assistant designed to combat drowsy driving proactively. Built on a Raspberry Pi with a camera, ALEx! detects early signs of fatigue (like yawning or nodding) and then engages the driver in active conversation and cognitive activities using Gemini-powered AI. From personalized small talk to brain games, storytelling, and number plate puzzles, ALEx! adapts in real-time to keep drivers alert, significantly reducing the risk of accidents on long or monotonous drives. It's your smart, proactive co-pilot for road safety.
